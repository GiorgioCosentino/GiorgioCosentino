## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 📦 Snap Packaging for Plastimatch

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/plastimatch)

- **Instant installation & portability:** The Snap package makes Plastimatch, a leading open-source medical imaging tool, installable in seconds on any Linux system with Snap support—no sysadmin skills or manual dependency wrangling needed.
- **Technical challenge solved:** Plastimatch relies on libraries like ITK/VTK, often causing compatibility headaches across distributions or virtual machines. My Snap resolves all dependencies, ensuring reliable operation even in isolated VM/container environments.
- **Clinical workflow impact:** Researchers and clinicians can process and visualize medical images with Plastimatch + 3D Slicer, reproducibly and securely, on Ubuntu, Debian, and beyond.

### ⚡ ECG Autoencoder (Python)
- Developed an autoencoder for ECG signal compression and reconstruction.
- Implemented in Python (TensorFlow/Keras): full code for preprocessing, model, training, and evaluation.
- **What does the autoencoder do?**  
  It analyzes ECG signals and distinguishes between normal and abnormal heartbeats, enabling automatic detection of anomalies for medical analysis.
- **Results:**  
  - Accuracy: **0.948**
  - Precision: **0.990**
  - Recall: **0.916**
- **Repository:** [Repository link](https://github.com/GiorgioCosentino/AutoEncoder-ECG)

### 🤖 Java Neural Network for Gaming
- Feedforward neural network in Java: **4 input neurons, 1 hidden layer (8 neurons), 3 output neurons**.
- Applied in a **1v1 mobile tank battle game**: the network receives the game state as input and outputs as actions or behaviors to apply against the player's tank.
- **Repository:** [Repository link](https://github.com/GiorgioCosentino/NeuralNetwork)

### 🌡️ Arduino Closed-Loop Controller
- Closed-loop system with temperature/humidity sensors and fan speed control.
- Arduino IDE & C/C++ for feedback regulation.
- **Repository:** [Repository link](https://github.com/GiorgioCosentino/Arduino-Closed-Loop-Controller-DHT11)
